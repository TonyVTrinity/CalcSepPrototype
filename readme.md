#Unit Test Project
I made a Proof of concept of a code seperated sysytem.

##Design Choices
- in order to enable easier passing around of joystick values, I packaged them into an array.

- I abstracted out a control of wpilib objects to several objects.

##Test Checklist
- [ ] Test Translation

- [ ] Test Rotation

- [ ] Test simultanious Translation and Rotation

- The bug I most expect is misaligned Talon's, or switched sine and cosine.
- If the bug is more than that please gather all information possible about it's occurence.

Thank you!!
